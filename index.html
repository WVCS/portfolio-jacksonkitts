  <p> There are many types of surfboards that people use. There are 3 main categories of Surfboards; Longboards, Shortboards, and Funboards. Although, there are many subcategories of each style. Each Board is designed the way it is for a specific type of surfing. For example, beginners would find it much easier to ride a longboard, because it is easy to keep your balance and easy to catch waves with a longer board, but professional surfers almost alwats prefer shortboards, because they are lighter and easier to turn and do tricks with. </p>
